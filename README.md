# 🍎 Fruits Explorer

A clean, focused React TypeScript application for exploring and collecting fruits with grouping and visualization features.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server (with proxy for CORS)
npm run dev

# Or start without proxy (may have CORS issues)
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## ✨ Features

### Core Requirements ✅
- **Data Fetching**: Uses external API with proper error handling
- **Layout**: Two-section layout (fruits list + jar)
- **Group By**: None, Family, Order, Genus options
- **Views**: Table and List views
- **Jar Functionality**: Add fruits, calculate calories, pie chart

### Additional Features 🎯
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- **Error Handling**: Loading states, error displays, retry functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Clean UI**: Modern, intuitive interface with Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Component tests with good coverage
- **Performance**: Optimized with React.memo and proper hooks

### Key Technologies
- **React 19** with hooks and modern patterns
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Axios** for API calls
- **Jest & Testing Library** for testing

## 🎯 Design Decisions

### 1. **Clean Architecture**
- Separation of concerns with clear component boundaries
- Custom hooks for business logic
- TypeScript interfaces for data contracts

### 2. **Performance Optimizations**
- React.memo for expensive components
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Debounced search for better UX

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Global error boundary
- API error handling with retry logic
- User-friendly error messages

### 4. **Testing Strategy**
- Component tests for critical functionality
- Mock API calls for reliable testing
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

## 📱 User Experience

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly interactions

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance

### Performance
- Fast initial load
- Smooth interactions
- Optimized re-renders
- Efficient data fetching

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Test Coverage
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction tests
- API integration tests
- Error handling tests

## 🚀 Deployment

The app is ready for deployment to any static hosting service:

- **Vercel**: `vercel --prod`
- **Netlify**: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=build`
- **GitHub Pages**: Configure in repository settings

## 🔧 Development

### CORS Handling
The app includes a proxy server to handle CORS issues with the external API:

```bash
# Run with proxy (recommended for development)
npm run dev

# Run proxy only
npm run proxy
```

### API Configuration
The app automatically switches between proxy (development) and direct API (production) based on the environment.
